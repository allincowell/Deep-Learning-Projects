# Deep Learning Projects

This repo contains the Deep Learning Projects done in my undergrad at IIT-KGP.

---

The assignment consists of 2 projects:

* **Project 1**
* **Project 2**

---

## Project 1

This assignment includes:

* Building and training a Residual Network Model (ResNet)
* Saving snapshots of your trained model
* Loading a pretrained model and finetuning on Office31 dataset
* Fine-tuning a pre-trained network
* Visualizations using TensorBoardLogger

## Project 2

This assignment includes:

* Building and training a Vision Transformer Model (ViT)
* Implementing Shifted Patch Token (SPT) for small datasets.
* Coding of basic blocks and then integration is done.

## Important Instruction

This code has been tested and should run for Python 3.7.10 with pytorch 1.7.0 and pytorch_lightning 1.2.0 in Google colab.
